# Overview
SiamNetSignature is a Python project that leverages a Siamese neural network for the task of signature verification. The Siamese network architecture is particularly effective for one-shot learning tasks, making it suitable for verifying the authenticity of signatures by comparing a pair of signature images.

# Features

Siamese Neural Network for signature verification
Data preprocessing and augmentation
Model training and evaluation scripts
Visualization tools for model performance

# Installation
To get started with SiamNetSignature, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.


git clone https://github.com/ahussain-ai/SiamNetSignature.git
cd SiamNetSignature
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Dataset Preparation
Ensure that your dataset is organized properly. The repository expects a certain structure for the dataset directory. Update the datasets.py script as needed to match your dataset's structure.

# Training
To train the Siamese network, use the train.py script. Adjust the hyperparameters as necessary.

python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.001

# Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using the eval.py script.

python eval.py --model_path path_to_trained_model --test_data path_to_test_data

# Visualization
Utilize the visualize.py script to visualize the performance of the model.

python visualize.py --model_path path_to_trained_model --test_data path_to_test_data
